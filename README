QHMC (aka FUEL)

Quick Build Instructions

QHMC uses autoconf and follows similar conventions to the rest of the
USQCD SciDAC libraries.  You will first need to install its dependencies:
qmp, qio, qla, qdp, and qopqdp.  The recommended versions of these
libraries are:

qmp-2.5.0
qio-2.4.1
qla-1.9.0
qdp-1.11.0
qopqdp-0.20.0

An example configure command is:

/home/osborn/lqcd/src/qhmc-0.1.4/configure \
 --prefix=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qhmc-0.1.4 \
 --with-qmp=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qmp \
 --with-qio=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qio \
 --with-qla=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qla \
 --with-qdp=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qdp \
 --with-qopqdp=/home/osborn/lqcd/install/qopqdp \
 --enable-nc=all \
 --enable-colors=n \
 CFLAGS="-Wall -std=gnu99 -O3 -g -DQDP_PROFILE"

CC will default to the same as used by QMP and can be overriden.

The "--enable-nc=" flag should match what was used to compile QOPQDP.
The default is "all".

The "--enable-colors=" is used to force the all fields to have the
specified color at compile time.  This may be faster in some cases,
but can prevent using any code that uses multiple Nc.  The allowed
values are 1,2,3, and n where "n" specifies that the fields can have
any Nc and can be specified at runtime.  This is the default.
