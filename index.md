# QHMC (FUEL) Lattice Field Theory Application

QHMC is an application for Lattice Field Theory using the
[Lua](http://www.lua.org)
scripting language on top of the
[USQCD SciDAC libraries](http://usqcd-software.github.io).  
It is also commonly referred to by the name FUEL
(Framework for Unified Evolution of Lattices).  
Though originally targeted for configuration generation,
it now has fairly extensive analysis capabilities.

The github source repository is [here](https://github.com/jcosborn/qhmc).

Tarballs for current and past releases can be found
[here](http://usqcd-software.github.io/downloads/qhmc).

Installation instructions are in the [README](doc/topics/README.html).

Online documentation for QHMC is [here](doc/index.html).
